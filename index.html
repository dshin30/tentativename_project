    <h2>What Makes PM2.5 So Dangerous?</h2>

    <p>
        PM2.5 consists of microscopic particles that enter deep lung tissue and even the bloodstream,
        increasing the risk of major health issues such as heart attacks, stroke, and lung cancer.

        <p class="figure-description">
            Smaller particles can bypass the body's natural defenses, reaching lower lung regions and even entering the bloodstream.

        <p class="figure-description">
            PM2.5 usually follows a seasonal cycle, but the first half of 2023 breaks the pattern with an unusually high value,
            again corresponding to wildfire smoke transport.

            This heatmap shows moderate fluctuations from 2016–2022, followed by a dramatic spike in 2023.

<!-- ================= TRAFFIC SECTION ================= -->

        <p class="caption">Figure 5. Heavy traffic in Manhattan.</p>
        <p class="figure-description">
            NYC traffic is dense throughout the day, but the data shows that high congestion does not always correspond
            to high PM2.5 levels.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Traffic is often blamed as the primary contributor to NYC's pollution.
        To test this assumption, we compare PM2.5 and traffic trends across COVID and recovery.

        <p class="figure-description">
            Surprisingly, traffic volume <strong>increased</strong> in several boroughs during COVID,
            while PM2.5 did not consistently improve.
            This indicates that traffic alone does not determine PM2.5 levels.

            PM2.5 jumped from a long-term average of ~6.8 µg/m³ to over 27 µg/m³ during the wildfire period.
            This demonstrates how extreme external events can overwhelm local emission sources like traffic.

    <h2>Relationship Between PM2.5 & Traffic</h2>

        <p class="caption">Figure 10. PM2.5 and traffic volume trends (2016–2025).</p>
        <p class="figure-description">
            These line charts show PM2.5 and traffic volume trends from 2016 to 2025 for each borough.
            The colored background bands mark the three eras: pre-COVID, COVID, and recovery.
            Traffic volume fluctuates year-to-year without a consistent long-term pattern,
            while PM2.5 levels shift independently and exhibit a pronounced spike in 2023.
            Notably, this spike occurs <strong>without any significant increase in traffic</strong>, reinforcing that the 
            wildfire smoke event—not local vehicle activity—was the dominant driver.
            Overall, the two curves rarely move together, illustrating the weak correlation between the two variables.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-center">
        <img src="static/images/PM_vs_Traffic_line.png" class="img-large">
        <p class="caption">Figure 11. Daily PM2.5 vs traffic (scatter with trend line).</p>
        <p class="figure-description">
            Each point in this scatter plot represents one day of data. The points form a wide, diffuse cloud rather
            than a narrow diagonal trend, showing that busy traffic days do not reliably correspond to higher PM2.5.
            Light-traffic days also do not guarantee better air quality. The regression line is almost flat,
            indicating virtually no linear relationship between the two variables.  
            This figure provides the most direct visual confirmation of our central finding:
            <strong>traffic volume alone is not a reliable predictor of PM2.5 levels in NYC.</strong>
            Instead, seasonal heating, temperature inversions, long-range pollution transport, and wildfire smoke 
            explain much of the observed PM2.5 variation.

<!-- ================= CONCLUSION ================= -->
<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The data clearly shows that NYC PM2.5 is shaped far more by external factors such as wildfire smoke,
        seasonal heating emissions, and regional pollution transport than by traffic alone.
