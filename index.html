        <p class="figure-description">
            Our analysis focuses on four boroughs — <strong>Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens</strong>.  
            Staten Island was excluded due to insufficient PM2.5 and traffic data coverage during the study period.  
            Understanding the spatial distribution of these four boroughs helps interpret borough-level patterns

    <h2>What Makes PM2.5 So Dangerous?</h2>

    <p class="figure-description">
        PM2.5 consists of microscopic particles that enter deep lung tissue and even the bloodstream,
        increasing the risk of major health issues such as heart attacks, stroke, and lung cancer.

        <p class="figure-description">
            PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 differ in how deeply they penetrate the human respiratory system: 
    PM10 particles are generally blocked in the upper airways, PM2.5 particles can reach the deeper lung regions including the alveoli, 
    and PM1 particles are small enough to potentially cross into the bloodstream, posing significant health risks.

    NYC traffic is dense throughout the day, but the data shows that high congestion does not always correspond

        PM2.5 jumped from the <strong>2016–2023 May average (~6.8 µg/m³)</strong> to over 
        <strong>27 µg/m³</strong> during the wildfire period. At this concentration—more than five times 
        the WHO guideline—studies show a <strong>20–40% increase in asthma attacks</strong>, a 
        <strong>5–15% rise in heart-attack and stroke–related emergency visits</strong>, and measurable 
        reductions in lung function. Even short-term exposure at this level raises long-term risks such as 
        <strong>cardiovascular disease</strong> and <strong>cancer</strong>, and wildfire-derived PM2.5 is 
        known to be more toxic than typical urban emissions. This demonstrates how extreme external events 
        can overwhelm local emission sources like traffic.

    <h2>Relationship Between PM2.5 & Traffic</h2>

        <p class="caption">Figure 10. PM2.5 and traffic volume trends (2016–2025).</p>
        <p class="figure-description">
            These line charts show PM2.5 and traffic volume trends from 2016 to 2025 for each borough.
            The colored background bands mark the three eras: pre-COVID, COVID, and recovery.
            Traffic volume fluctuates year-to-year without a consistent long-term pattern,
            while PM2.5 levels shift independently and exhibit a pronounced spike in 2023.
            Notably, this spike occurs <strong>without any significant increase in traffic</strong>, reinforcing that the 
            wildfire smoke event—not local vehicle activity—was the dominant driver.
            Overall, the two curves rarely move together, illustrating the weak correlation between the two variables.

        <p class="figure-description">
            Each point in this scatter plot represents one day of data. The points form a wide, diffuse cloud rather
            than a narrow diagonal trend, showing that busy traffic days do not reliably correspond to higher PM2.5.
            Light-traffic days also do not guarantee better air quality. The regression line is almost flat,
            indicating virtually no linear relationship between the two variables.  
            This figure provides the most direct visual confirmation of our central finding:
            <strong>traffic volume alone is not a reliable predictor of PM2.5 levels in NYC.</strong>
            Instead, seasonal heating, temperature inversions, long-range pollution transport, and wildfire smoke 
            explain much of the observed PM2.5 variation.

<!-- ================= CONCLUSION ================= -->
<section id="outro" class="card-section">
    <h2>Conclusion & Outlook</h2>

    <p>
        Our original question was straightforward:
        <strong>does NYC traffic determine PM2.5?</strong>
        After examining nine years of borough-level data, our answer is
        <strong>“not really.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The 2023 Canadian wildfires produced the clearest and strongest PM2.5 spike in the entire dataset,
        overwhelming the influence of local traffic. This suggests that improving NYC air quality requires strategies addressing
        regional pollution transport, climate-driven wildfire risk, and building-related emissions.
    </p>

    <p>
        After seeing that traffic and PM2.5 had almost no clear relationship, we also considered that this pattern may be partly due
        to the gradual increase in electric and other environment-friendly vehicles over the years. Cleaner engines and stronger
        emission controls can allow traffic volumes to grow without causing a matching rise in PM2.5.
    </p>

    <p>
        Future work could combine mobility data with weather and satellite-based smoke indicators to build predictive models.
        Even with limitations, the project shows that <strong>“more traffic” is a poor shortcut for “worse air”</strong> in NYC.
