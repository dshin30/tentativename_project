    <h2>New York City Overview</h2>
    <p>
        New York City is one of the most densely populated urban regions in the world.
        With millions of residents, five major boroughs, and heavy daily traffic, air quality is a critical public health priority.
    </p>

    <h2>What is PM2.5?</h2>
    <p>
        PM2.5 refers to particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers—small enough to travel deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream.
        These particles come from vehicle emissions, industrial activity, building fuel combustion, and wildfire smoke.

<section id="traffic">
    <h2>Traffic Conditions in NYC</h2>
    <p>
        Traffic congestion is one of NYC’s most recognizable features.
        Vehicle emissions contribute significantly to PM2.5 levels—especially during peak commuting hours.
    </p>

<section id="wildfire">
    <h2>Wildfire Smoke Impact</h2>
    <p>
        In 2023, massive wildfires in Canada pushed smoke across the East Coast.
        NYC recorded some of the worst PM2.5 levels in modern history.
    </p>

    <h2>PM2.5 & Traffic Visualizations</h2>

    <!-- Figure 5 -->
    <div class="image-center">
        <img src="static/images/PM_by_year.png" alt="PM by year" class="img-large">
        <p class="caption">Figure 5. Annual PM2.5 averages (2016–2025).</p>
        <p class="figure-analysis">
            This heatmap shows how yearly average PM2.5 changed from 2016 to 2025 in each NYC borough. 
            While normal fluctuations appear every year, 2023 shows a clear spike in the Bronx and Queens, 
            matching the timing of the Canadian wildfire smoke. This indicates that PM2.5 trends are not driven 
            solely by local traffic and that extreme external events can strongly affect air quality.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Figure 6 -->
    <div class="image-center">
        <img src="static/images/pm_traffic_distribution.png" alt="PM Traffic Distribution" class="img-large">
        <p class="caption">Figure 6. PM and traffic distribution across time.</p>
        <p class="figure-analysis">
            These bar charts compare median PM2.5 and traffic volume before COVID, during COVID, 
            and in recovery years. Traffic decreased drastically during COVID, but PM2.5 did not improve 
            in the same way and even increased afterward in some boroughs. This demonstrates that lowering traffic 
            alone is not enough to significantly reduce PM2.5, and other environmental or external influences play major roles.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Figure 7 -->
    <div class="image-center">
        <img src="static/images/pm2.5_traffic_volume_distributionbyyear_line.png" alt="PM & Traffic line" class="img-large">
        <p class="caption">Figure 7. PM2.5 and traffic volume by year (line chart).</p>
        <p class="figure-analysis">
            This line chart shows the movement of PM2.5 and traffic from 2016 to 2025. 
            Traffic dropped clearly during the COVID period, but PM2.5 did not follow the same downward pattern. 
            The 2023 wildfire spike appears independently from traffic activity, showing little long-term correlation 
            between the two metrics. Traffic changes do not closely match PM2.5 changes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Figure 8 -->
    <div class="image-center">
        <img src="static/images/HalfyearPM.png" alt="Halfyear PM" class="img-large">
        <p class="caption">Figure 8. Half-year PM2.5 averages (2016–2025).</p>
        <p class="figure-analysis">
            Most half-year periods show stable PM2.5 levels, but the first half of 2023 exhibits a sharp and unusual rise. 
            This spike aligns directly with the 2023 Canadian wildfires, showing how a short-term but intense event 
            can drastically worsen air quality, even when traffic levels remain relatively unchanged.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Figure 9 -->
    <div class="image-center">
        <img src="static/images/PM_vs_Traffic_line.png" alt="PM vs Traffic line" class="img-large">
        <p class="caption">Figure 9. Traffic volume vs PM2.5: almost no linear relationship.</p>
        <p class="figure-analysis">
            In the scatter plot, each dot represents one day of traffic and PM2.5 measurements. 
            The wide, scattered distribution shows no strong linear pattern. High traffic does not always lead to high PM2.5, 
            nor does low traffic guarantee cleaner air. This confirms our main finding: traffic impacts PM2.5, 
            but it is not the dominant factor behind major changes, which are mostly influenced by external environmental events.
