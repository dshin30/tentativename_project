    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In June 2023, New York City briefly recorded some of the worst air quality in the world, even though daily
        traffic looked mostly normal. This project asks a simple question: <strong>did changes in NYC traffic volume
        actually drive PM2.5 levels between 2016 and 2025?</strong> Using borough-level data, we compare PM2.5 with
        traffic across three periods—pre-COVID, COVID, and recovery—and highlight the 2023 Canadian wildfire event.
    </p>
    <p>
        Across multiple visualizations, we find <strong>no stable relationship</strong> between traffic and PM2.5.
        During COVID, traffic patterns changed but PM2.5 did not improve in a consistent way, and the sharp 2023 spike
        appears clearly tied to wildfire smoke rather than vehicle activity. Our results suggest that while traffic
        contributes to pollution on individual days, <strong>regional and external factors such as wildfires and
        long-range transport are far more important for NYC’s PM2.5 trends</strong>.

<section id="nyc-intro">
    <h2>New York City Overview</h2>
    <p>
        New York City is one of the most densely populated urban regions in the world.
        With millions of residents, five major boroughs, and heavy daily traffic, air quality is a critical public health priority.
    </p>

            Our analysis aggregates data for the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. Staten Island appears on the
            map but is excluded from most plots because of missing or inconsistent traffic records.

<!-- ================= PM EXPLANATION ================= -->
<section id="pm25">
    <h2>What Makes Air Pollution (PM2.5) So Dangerous?</h2>
    <p>
        Fine particulate matter, known as <strong>PM2.5</strong>, consists of microscopic particles smaller than
        2.5 micrometers—about 1/30 the width of a human hair. Because they are so tiny, they bypass the body’s natural
        defenses and travel deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream.
    </p>

    <div class="image-center">
        <img src="static/images/pm_lung.jpeg" alt="PM entering lungs" class="img-mid">
        <p class="caption">Figure 2. PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 penetrating different parts of the respiratory system.</p>
        <p class="figure-description">
            According to the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> and the <strong>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong>,
            smaller particles pose a far greater health risk:
            <br><br>
            • <strong>PM10</strong> usually stays in the nose and upper airway.<br>
            • <strong>PM2.5</strong> reaches the bronchi and lung tissue.<br>
            • <strong>PM1</strong> and ultrafine particles can enter the <strong>bloodstream</strong>, affecting the heart and other organs.
            <br><br>
            Extensive medical research (Harvard School of Public Health, 2015–2023) shows that long-term exposure to PM2.5
            increases the risk of <strong>asthma, heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, and premature death</strong>.  
            This is why even small changes in PM2.5 levels can drastically affect public health—especially in dense cities like NYC.

<!-- ================= TRAFFIC ================= -->
<section id="traffic">
    <h2>Traffic Conditions in NYC</h2>
    <p>
        Traffic congestion is one of NYC’s most recognizable features.
        Vehicle emissions contribute to PM2.5, especially during peak commuting hours,
        but our analysis tests whether traffic alone is enough to explain long-term air quality.
    </p>

        <p class="figure-description">
            Intuitively, it is easy to assume that “more cars = worse air.” The later figures show that this intuition
            does not hold when we look at nine years of data across multiple boroughs.

<!-- ================= WILDFIRE ================= -->
<section id="wildfire">
    <h2>Wildfire Smoke Impact</h2>
    <p>
        In 2023, massive wildfires in Canada pushed smoke across the East Coast.
        NYC recorded some of the worst PM2.5 levels in modern history, briefly ranking among the most polluted cities
        in the world.
    </p>

            <p class="figure-description">
                Large wildfires inject enormous amounts of fine particulate matter into the atmosphere. Under the right
                wind conditions, this smoke can travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers and settle over distant
                cities that did not generate the pollution themselves.

            <p class="figure-description">
                The orange sky over Manhattan in June 2023 corresponds to one of the strongest PM2.5 spikes in our
                dataset. Local traffic did not change dramatically on that day, highlighting how external events can
                dominate NYC’s air quality.

<!-- ================= OUTRO ================= -->
<section id="outro">
    <h2>Conclusion & Outlook</h2>
    <p>
        Our original question was straightforward: <strong>does NYC traffic determine PM2.5?</strong>  
        After nine years of data analysis, the answer is <strong>“not really.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        External factors—most notably the 2023 Canadian wildfires—produced the strongest PM2.5 spikes in the dataset,
        overshadowing traffic-related contributions.
